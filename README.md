Sync files & directories from your Mac with a remote directory

### V1

My workflow is have two main project roots:
	1. Active Projects
	2. Completed Projects

When looking though the script you'll see that I am setting variables and syncing both local roots to the remote counterparts. In the event you do not need to back up multiple local roots, comment/remove superfluous code.
